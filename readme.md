We want to visit all of the places connected by these roads, but we want to do it in a smart way so that we don't waste time going back and forth on the same road. This is called a "breadth-first search".

The code shows how we can use Python to do this. First, we create an empty list called visited to keep track of the places we've been to. We also create an empty list called queue.

Then we define a function called bfs(). This function takes three inputs: our visited list, our graph, and the starting node.

We start by adding our starting node to our visited list and our queue.

Next, we enter a loop. Inside the loop, we take the first element (place) from the front of our queue and call it m. We then print m to show that we've visited this place.

For each place m that we are currently at, we look at all the neighboring places (the ones that share a road with m). For each neighboring place (neighbour), if we haven't visited it yet, we add it to our visited list and our queue.

We keep doing this until there are no more places left in our queue.

Finally, we call the bfs() function with our starting node and print out all the places we've visited in order using the breadth-first search method.


This code is like a game, where you have some letters like "a", "b", and "c". You have to find all the ways you can arrange them.

For example, if you have one letter, there is only one way you can arrange it: by itself. If you have two letters, there are two ways you can arrange them: "ab" or "ba".

The code uses a special trick called recursion to find all the possible arrangements for any number of letters. It first checks how many letters there are. If there is only one, then that's the only way to arrange them.

If there are more than one, the code makes a list of all the possible ways you can arrange the letters. To do this, it takes each letter one by one and adds it to each possible arrangement of the other remaining letters.

Finally, the code prints out all the possible arrangements for different numbers of letters.
